There are two main assignments for this course: a class presentation and a final paper.

Class Presentation

Each student must give a class presenation focusing on an article selected from the syllabus reading list.

Final Paper

Students must write a research paper to be turned in at the end of the term. Each student should consult with the instructor on the possible topics to work on, but they should relate to the topics we deal with in class.

Some sample topics for the final paper are as follows:

1) Scrambling and the issue of optionality

2) Locative inversion

3) Case and agreement

4) EPP

5) Wh-questions
